# Faceted Search

## Developing

### Adding Modular Components

New Angular-specific constructs like components, dependencies, tests, etc should be done using the angular cli.

For example, use `ng generate component xyz` to create a new component instead of manually creating the source files by hand.

The Angular cli has commands for Components, Materials, Tests, and Dependencies.

## Building

To start the project, run `ng serve ` from the `faceted-search` directory.
