        <h2>Know Where Graph</h2>
        <p>The KnowWhereGraph supports data-driven decisions by integrating a wide range of environmental and human data under a common geographic and semantic framework. Navigating this growing universe of data requires a user-friendly and sophisticated
            search interface to guide a user to information that addresses their goal. The KnowWhereGraph’s Faceted Search Interface provides a dynamic set of filters related to attributes—or facets—of the various datasets in the graph that allow a user
            to quickly refine their search. Clickable links in the search results encourage the user to explore data tangential but related to their initial query that may lead to new insights. By presenting filter options that are dynamically updated
            as the search is refined, the interface helps the user understand the structure and content of the datasets within the KnowWhereGraph.</p>
        <p>Among the featured application areas of the KnowWhereGraph is humanitarian response following a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or wildfire. Beginning from a place, hazard type or area of expertise as entry points into the graph, a data
            analyst can use the filters and interactive map of the Faceted Search Interface to answer questions like, “What happened here?” “Where should we send emergency supplies?” and “Whom should we consult for expert advice?” In a time-sensitive
            context, the KnowWhereGraph and Faceted Search Interface enable responders to quickly learn about potential consequences to medical infrastructure, vulnerable human populations and other factors that augment their situational awareness.</p>
